# üöÄ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program Progress Repository

Welcome to my documentation repository for the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, where I track and document my weekly progress on tasks assigned as part of the program.  
This repo serves as a complete logbook of my journey, learnings, and outcomes while building towards a silicon tapeout using open-source EDA tools.

## üìñ About RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is an initiative to provide hands-on learning in **VLSI design, RISC-V architecture, and SoC (System-on-Chip) development**, guiding participants from RTL design all the way to tapeout.  
The program emphasizes **open-source EDA tools**, industry-standard flows, and practical chip implementation knowledge.
